# iOS Playground

This repository contains experiments and small projects for learning Swift and iOS development.

## ToolsApp

The `ToolsApp` directory provides a SwiftUI application prepared for multiple tools. The first tool implemented is a focus timer that alternates between focus and relax intervals.

Open `ToolsApp` in Xcode to build and run on your iPhone.
